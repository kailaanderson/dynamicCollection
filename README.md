# dynamicCollection
In this project, I implemented a dynamic array with functions to add and remove numbers from the array. This project demonstrates understanding of dynamic arrays and how to manipulate them. collection.cpp holds all of the function definitions and numCollection.cpp holds the code for the user to start and manipulate their array.
